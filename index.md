I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Jeffrey Blume](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/JeffreyBlume).

<br />
My research focuses on the large scale inference. I am also doing research on predicting the penetrance of rare diseases from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation)

<br /> 
Before coming to Vanderbilt, I obtained my Master of Public Health degree at Boston University with a concentration on Biostatistics. I worked as the Lead Biostatistician at Boston University Center for Clinical Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research ([CTECER](http://sites.bu.edu/tec/)) for one year after the program. I worked closely with [Dr. Bindu Kalesan](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/bindu-kalesan/)

<br />
From my past experiences on various projects, I am very passionate about large scale inference and translational research. I am currently looking for **2020 summer internship** and wish to find my next journey out of campus.
