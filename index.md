I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, the University of Texas at Arlington. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Junzhou Huang](http://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/).

<br />
My research focuses on the deep learning with its applications especially for medical imaging and Health Informatics. I am doing research on survival prediction which can help doctors to make treatment decision using patients' big Imaging Genomics data. 

<br /> 
Before coming to UTA, I finished my master thesis with the topic of background subtraction with matrix decomposition. At part-time, I was responsible for a project using Kinect as the "eye" of the robot. This won the 1st place in "Microsoft Student Challenge 2012" from 530 nationwide teams.[[link]](http://jwyao.weebly.com/robot.html)[[MSRA News]](http://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/news/features/aca84558-3608-425f-a2ea-ac73d53bf7d2).

<br />
From my past experiences on various projects, I am very passionate about AI in medicine and computer vision. I am currently looking for **2018 summer internship** and wish to find my next journey out of campus.
