I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University. I am working under the supervision of [<span style="color:blue;"> Dr. Jeffrey D. Blume</span>](https://www.statisticalevidence.com/about) and his Statistical Evidence in Data Science lab.  

<br />
My statistical research focuses on large scale inference, second-generation p-values, and model selection with penalized likelihoods. My collaborative research involves predicting the penetrance of rare diseases from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation). This exciting work was done in [<span style="color:blue;">Kroncke lab</span>](https://kroncke-lab.github.io).  

<br /> 
Before coming to Vanderbilt, I obtained my Master's of Public Health at Boston University with a concentration in Biostatistics. I was the Lead Biostatistician in the Boston University Center for Clinical Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research ([<span style="color:blue;">CTECER</span>](http://sites.bu.edu/tec/)) for several years. I continued to work closely with [<span style="color:blue;">Dr. Bindu Kalesan</span>](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/bindu-kalesan/) on a variety of projects.  

<br />
On a personal note, I'm very interested in aviation, and my flight history is shown in the graphic header. When I'm not doing Biostatistics or data science (or studying for classes), I'm flying somewhere new or analyzing aviation [<span style="color:blue;">trends</span>](\	PDF\bos_poster.pdf).
