The key ideas of primal dual active set (PDAS) algorithm for solving the best subset selection problem is summarized here. The original paper can be found [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v094i04). They also have a very nice R package on [<span style="color:blue;"> CRAN </span>](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BeSS/index.html).
