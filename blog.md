## MLE, Fisher's information, and robust standard error 

This is a [<span style="color:blue;">post</span>]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link doc/information.md %} ) on a couple of concepts in the foundation of statistical inference. It talks about how to find the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), calculate the expected and estimated Fisher's information, and derive a robust standard error when the working model fails. 

## Best subset selection using primal dual active set (PDAS) algorithm
