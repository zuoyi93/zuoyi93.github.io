This page will show my solution for the DSB 2017 Challenge. During this challenge, I learnt much things and will do better in the future.

####  Overall Pipeline

<br />
At first, 2D U-Net is trained to detect nodule candidates on each slice. Then a 3D candidates generation is performed to find all 3D connected components (some very small components will be ignored). We then train a multi-scale 3D CNN to further detect the probability of one candidate to be a nodule.

Since DSB 2017 doesn't provide any information about lung nodule. Therefore, many teams and us used LUNA 16 challenge data to train the model.

- 3D Candidates

<br />
From U-net, we can have many nodule candidates in 2D slices. We can find the 3D connected components by stacking all 2D results.

- 3D Multi-Scale CNN (Dou et al. TBME 2017)

<br />
We implemented the model in the paper and train the 3D multi-scale CNN on 3D nodules. Therefore, each candidate from the last step can be given a probability to be a lung nodule.

- Assign nodule probability to patient-level

We just simply assign three top highest probability of candidates to be nodules to the patient as one vector and train the classifier using xgboost. Although it is not good, we don't have enough time at that time.
