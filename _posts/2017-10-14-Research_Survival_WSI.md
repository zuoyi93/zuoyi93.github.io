### Short Abstract

We propose an effective Whole Slide Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework (WSISA).
-  To exploit survival-discriminative patterns from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from each WSI by adaptive sampling and then group these images into different clusters. 
- We propose to train an aggregation model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results.
