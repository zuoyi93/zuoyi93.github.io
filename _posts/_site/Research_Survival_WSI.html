<p>In this post I’ll share some of my experiences building my personal academic website. I started with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I had never built a decent webpage before and I didn’t want to spend a lot of time learning.</li>
  <li>I wanted <strong>free hosting without ads</strong>.</li>
  <li>The page should contain a <strong>blog</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy-to-mantain publications</strong> page.</li>
  <li>It should look well both in mobiles and computers.</li>
  <li>I wanted the solution to be as <strong>long-lasting</strong> as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started by searching for “free web hosting” at Google, and so I started by exploring sites like <a href="weebly.com">Weebly</a>. It was free (for my current needs), easy to use, acceptably customizable, and looked good on mobiles. The problem for me were the long-term implications of hosting and editing everything on a <em>closed</em> site: what if my expectations from the web change in the future? Would I be able to export all the work put into it if the conditions for the service change?</p>

<p><br />
I ended up finding <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, which allowed me to host my page for free, and edit everything locally through git. Awesome! But then how to create a nice webpage with a blog? (Remember I am a completely newbie at this)… yep, I’ve seen that I should use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, but I also want my site to look nice! Thankfully, I came across an awesome template, called <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a>, that was a good starting point. The same author has another theme <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme">So Simple</a>, big kudos to <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes">Michael Rose</a>!</p>

<p><br />
The only thing I needed, therefore, was to fork the Minimal Mistakes repository into a new repository in my git, with the name:</p>

I did some small changes, I pushed them to github, and <em>voilà</em>! My page was up and running! So far I had fulfilled all constraints but one: having an easy-to-mantain publications page. Let’s get to it!</p>
