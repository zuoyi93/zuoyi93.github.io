<p>This page will show my solution for the DSB 2017 Challenge. I will do better after chanllenge.</p>

<p>my customary update of percentage of <i>deep-learning papers</i> in the major vision conferences. At CVPR 2015, I described its <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-scraping/">exponential growth</a>, and after ICCV 2015 I wondered whether it had <a href="http://localhost:4000/deep-learning-plateau/">plateaued</a>.<br />
<br />
<del>Since the CVF has not released the papers yet, I had to adapt my script to take the titles from the program.</del>
[UPDATE] CVF papers are online, so we can use the generic script shown below.<br />
<br />
You can download all titles in TXT format in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nhsric6bksopot3/AADz3BWN6I8i1VsDNLOpvdDAa?dl=0">here</a></p>

<p>And the plot using XKCD style, as described in this <a href="http://localhost:4000/xkcd-deep-learning/">blog post</a>:
