<p>Maybe you have some old documents with nasty equations written in Word, but now you need to re-use them in LaTeX (maybe for your dissertation), and of course you don’t want to re-type everything.
Thankfully, there exists <a href="http://writer2latex.sourceforge.net">writer2latex</a> that will help you do that. Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>writer2latex takes a LibreOffice document as input, so first thing is to <strong>download and install <a href="http://writer2latex.sourceforge.net">LibreOffice</a></strong>, open your Word document (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.doc</code>) and <strong>save it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.odt</code></strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then <strong>download and install <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">writer2latex</a></strong> and read the instructions on how to run it. In Unix, for instance, it involved changing the execution permissions of the binary: <code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod +x w2l</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the code:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">./w2l -ultraclean Text.odt Text.tex</code>
We use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-ultraclean</code> option to get rid of all formatting, since <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> will take care of that.
It is probable that the generated <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> won’t compile at first, so I recommend you get the parts you’re interested in by pieces into your final document.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Big kudos to Henrik Just!</p>
