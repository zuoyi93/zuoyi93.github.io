I will share my projects and codes here.

### Research

* [**FTVNNR**]({{ site.url }}/dynamic_MRI/)<br>
An efficient algorithm to solve dynamic MRI using low-rank and total variation constraints. From our MICCAI 2015 paper.

* [**LSD**]({{ site.url }}/LSD/)<br>
Method for background subtraction using low rank and structured sparsity decomposition. From our ICME 2014 and TIP 2015 papers.

* [**Attention-based MIL**](https://github.com/utayao/Atten_Deep_MIL)<br>
This is a re-implementation of one interesting paper "Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning". Please check my Github for more information. 
 
### Challenge

* [**Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017**]({{ site.url }}/Our_DSB/)<br>
My solution for the DSB 2017. 

* [**Winner of Microsoft Student Challenge**](http://jwyao.weebly.com/robot.html)<br>
The page to show the demo of our project. The challenge aims to build an intelligent system using Kinect. This was one pioneering work and has been in an invited chapter of the [book](https://book.douban.com/subject/20423598/) published by Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) to motivate Kinect Developers in China.
