* SCN5A <br>
Bayesian priors for penetrance of Brugada syndrome from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation) using empirical bayes and EM alogrithm. Paper published [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008862)
