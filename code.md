I will share some of my notes and projects here.


## Statistical notes

* MLE, Fisher's information, and robust standard error <br>

This is a [<span style="color:blue;">post</span>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link doc\information.md %}) on a couple of concepts in the foundation of statistical inference. 

## Research

* Second Generation P Values Model Selection <br>
We developed an R package *fractions* for model selection using Second Generation P Values. Click [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ProSGPV) for more details on CRAN, or [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://github.com/zuoyi93/ProSGPV) to see a development version.  

* SCN5A <br>
Bayesian priors for penetrance of Brugada syndrome from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation) using empirical bayes and EM alogrithm. Paper published [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008862)
