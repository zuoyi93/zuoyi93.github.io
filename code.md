I will share my projects and codes here.

### Research

* Second Generation P Values Model Selection <br>
We developed an R package *fractions* for model selection using Second Generation P Values. Click [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://github.com/zuoyi93/fractions) for more details.  

* SCN5A <br>
Bayesian priors for penetrance of Brugada syndrome from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation) using empirical bayes and EM alogrithm   

<!--
* [**LSD**]({{ site.url }}/LSD/)<br>
Method for background subtraction using low rank and structured sparsity decomposition. From our ICME 2014 and TIP 2015 papers.


* [**Attention-based MIL**](https://github.com/utayao/Atten_Deep_MIL)<br>
This is a re-implementation of one interesting paper "Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning". Please check my Github for more information.
