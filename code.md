I will post some of my statistical notes and thoughts here.

### MLE, Fisher's information, and robust standard error 

Posted: 4/15/2021  

This is a [<span style="color:blue;">post</span>]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link doc/information.md %} ) on a couple of concepts in the foundation of statistical inference. It talks about how to find the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), calculate the expected and estimated Fisher's information, and derive a robust standard error when the working model fails. 

### Best subset selection using primal dual active set (PDAS) algorithm

Posted: 4/21/2021  

This [<span style="color:blue;">post</span>]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link doc/pdas.md %} ) summarizes the key ideas of the primal dual active set (PDAS) algorithm to solve the best subset selection problem.  The original paper can be found [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v094i04). They also have a very nice R package on [<span style="color:blue;"> CRAN </span>](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BeSS/index.html).
